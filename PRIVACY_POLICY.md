### Privacy Policy (English)

**Last Updated: July 8, 2025**

We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how the "Highlighting Translate" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

**Information We Process**

To provide its core functionality, the Extension processes two types of information:

1.  **Selected Text Content**: The text you highlight on a webpage is captured in order to be sent for translation.
2.  **User Settings**: We store your preferences, such as your target translation language, whether auto-translate is enabled, and the translation delay time.

**How We Use Your Information**

*   **Selected Text**: The text you select is sent directly to Google Translate's API in real-time to retrieve a translation. **We do not store, log, or share any of the text content you select.** This processing is entirely ephemeral.
*   **User Settings**: Your settings are stored securely in your browser using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. This allows your preferences to be synced across devices where you are logged in and ensures a personalized experience. These settings are not accessible to us (the developers).

**Information We Do Not Collect**

We **do not** collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Your name
*   Your email address
*   Your IP address
*   Your browsing history or activity

**Third-Party Services**

The Extension relies on the **Google Translate API** to provide translations. As such, the text you select is sent to Google's servers for processing. We recommend you review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to understand how they handle data.

Other than for the purpose of translation via Google Translate, we do not share any information with any other third parties.

**Security**

We are committed to keeping your information secure. All user settings are managed by the Chrome browser's built-in secure storage. As stated, we do not store any of the web content you select.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review it periodically.
